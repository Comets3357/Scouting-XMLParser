This is a guide to the XML parser program and an explanation as to how everything works.
The XML parser takes data line by line from the "Read" file and turns the given inputs into XML code.
The parser works in three phases, Dual, Tele, and Auto. The program shifts to them in this order.
You must give your input in this order. Name of reference in code, the type of variable, what will show up in the app
(ex. ver, INTEGER, version. create an integer named ver, but show up as version in the app)
each sort of line must have only two commas and must be used to separate from the name in reference, data type, and
what will show up in the app.

The dual mode will give two outputs. it will take the both the name for the reference in code and what will show
up in the app and add tele to the front for one output and put auto for the other output

both tele and auto phase are like dual, but they are seperate. these phases should be used when you want to make
a data point for either teleop or auton parts of the match for the app.

inorder to change phases, make a line that simply says "stop". This will tell the program that you do not want it
read in the mode you are currently in and cause a change in phases so if you are in dual, inputing "stop" will put
the program in the tele phase.

Once you tell the program to stop while it is in auto, It will start reading for names. You can input names however you
want weather that be line by line, or as a list separated by commas.
